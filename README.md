# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was created to help us use everything we have learned about excel thus far and had us do some guessing and learning of our own. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to go over everything we have learned in class and test us on our adaptability and flexibility within Microsoft Excel.


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first deliverable went smoothly, and I didn’t have much trouble completing that chart. It was helpful to learn, and I wish I had known how to analyze data in this manner while I was still in undergrad. I had a bit of trouble understanding how to change the years in the x-axis to months but once I figured it out it went smoothly.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second deliverable was a bit more difficult for me as the functions were much longer and I wasn’t used to this length. I enjoyed getting to use countifs because I believe this practice could be very useful in many different scenarios. Once I got the hang of it, it was much easier to just copy and paste the countifs for the number successful, failed, and canceled. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I was confused when all the countifs for canceled were zero, so I had to go back to the original dataset to make sure it was true. My next hiccup was that the row labels were sorted alphanumerically, and there was one row that should’ve been in the beginning that came up near the end which skewed the chart. I had to find a way to move the row with number 5000 to 9999 from the bottom to the top which I just did by right clicking the cell in the pivot table.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Conclusions I could make is that theatre outcomes tended to be most successful in the middle of the year, specifically May, while they were the least successful towards the end of the year. There were also more cancellations in January.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	We can conclude that the higher number of monies asked for the goal tended to result in a lesser success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?	
Some limitations of this dataset include that there is no way of telling how much money was made even if it was successful, or how much money was lost even it failed or was canceled.
