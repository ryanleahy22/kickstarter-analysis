# kickstarter-analysis
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was created to help us use everything we have learned about excel thus far and had us do some guessing and learning of our own. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to go over everything we have learned in class and test us on our adaptability and flexibility within Microsoft Excel.


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first deliverable went smoothly, and I didn’t have much trouble completing that chart. This deliverable was essentially to help someone find out whether or not there is a correlation between the launch date of a theatre kickstarter and its success/failure. In fact, I found that a theatre kickstarter's failure or cancellation doesn't have much to do with the time of year, as the number of failed kickstarts stayed consistent. On the other hand, success rates had a much higher correlation with the time of year as I found that success rates skyrocket beginning in March, and peaking in May. May also has the highest number of total kickstarters in the year, but I would say that the best time to fund a kickstarter in theatre is in mid to late Spring. This correlation can be seen in the following chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second deliverable was a bit more difficult for me as the functions were much longer and I wasn’t used to this length. I enjoyed getting to use countifs because I believe this practice could be very useful in many different scenarios. This part of the challenge was interesting as I noticed that the vast majority of kickstarters are in the first two rows with the lesser money goals. As the number got higher, the percentage failed seemed to get higher and the number of total projects got much lower. this is seen in the table below. From this I can gather that expensive projects are much more likely to fail.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I was confused when all the countifs for canceled were zero, so I had to go back to the original dataset to make sure it was true. My next hiccup was that the row labels were sorted alphanumerically, and there was one row that should’ve been in the beginning that came up near the end which skewed the chart. I had to find a way to move the row with number 5000 to 9999 from the bottom to the top which I just did by right clicking the cell in the pivot table. I also had a bit of trouble understanding how to change the years in the x-axis to months but I ended up just right clicking and removing years and quarters.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Conclusions I could make is that theatre outcomes tended to be most successful in the middle of the year, specifically May, while they were the least successful towards the end of the year. There were also more cancellations in January. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	We can conclude that the higher number of monies asked for the goal tended to result in a lesser success rate. Another conclusion is that less costly kickstarters were much more successful. If we wanted a more successful campaign that was also expensive, it would be best to have a goal in the 35000 to 45000 range.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?	
Some limitations of this dataset include that there isn't much of a sample set for expensive kickstarters. Also, there is no way of knowing why there is a season, or a set few months when theatre kickstarters become so popular. It could be because of the weather, overall sentiments, or also because thats when theatres are open. Although it's a strong correlation, the reason for the correlation is unknown.
